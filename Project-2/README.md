Greedy versus Exhaustive
> Both algorithms will be used to solve an interesting problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project we will implement and compare two algorithms that solve the same problem. 
For this problem, we will design:
- [ ] two separate algorithms
- [ ] describe the algorithms using clear pseudocode
- [ ] analyze them mathematically
- [ ] implement your algorithms in C++
- [ ] measure their performance in running time
- [ ] compare your experimental results with the efficiency class of your algorithms
- [ ] draw conclusions
The first is a greedy algorithm with a fast (i.e. polynomial) running time, while the second is an exhaustive search algorithm with a slow (i.e. exponential) running time.

## A description of the problem at hand is as follows:
| Container ship weight-maximization problem |
| -- |
|input: A positive “volume limit” budget V (floating point of TEUs); and a vector G of  n “goods” objects, containing one or more goods where each cargo item a=(w, v) has floating point weight w>0 and volume in cubic meters v>=0
output: A vector K of goods drawn from G, such that the sum of volumes of goods from K is within the prescribed volume limit Vand the sum of the goods’ weight is maximized. In other words:
(w,vt)Gv V;and the sum of all goods’ weights (w, v)w is maximized |
